## 1. Executive Context

Bobyard is an AI-powered takeoff and estimating platform that uses proprietary computer vision to automate 70–90% of the quantity and material takeoff process for commercial landscape contractors. Founded in 2023 by Stanford CS graduate Michael Ding, the company raised a $35M Series A led by 8VC in December 2025 and serves mid-market and enterprise landscaping firms handling $3M–$20M+ commercial installation projects. Bobyard is executing a vertical AI playbook—win the hardest trade first (landscaping), then expand into drywall, electrical, HVAC, plumbing, and framing—in a $1T+ U.S. construction market that remains one of the least digitized industries on earth.

## 2. Value Proposition Analysis

**What they solve (real pain, not marketing language):**
Estimators at commercial landscape contractors spend hours to days manually counting thousands of plant symbols, measuring linear footage, and calculating area coverage from architectural drawings—where a single miscount can blow a bid margin or lose a project entirely. Bobyard's CV models automate symbol counting, linear measurement, area detection, and text parsing simultaneously, cutting takeoff time by 50–70% and enabling a single estimator to turn out $30M in bids instead of $15M.

**Who feels this pain most acutely:**
Commercial landscape contractors in the $5M–$50M revenue range who are capacity-constrained on estimating headcount. Specifically, firms where the owner or a single senior estimator is the bottleneck on bid volume—they're leaving revenue on the table because they physically cannot respond to enough RFPs. This pain spikes during bid season (spring) and when firms are crossing the residential-to-commercial threshold.

**The cost of inaction:**
- Estimating errors cost U.S. construction firms an estimated $273B annually (NCHRP data), with up to 20% of total project costs attributable to estimation mistakes
- A landscape contractor with one estimator capped at $15M in annual bids is forfeiting $15M+ in addressable work
- Manual inconsistency across estimators leads to unpredictable margins—winning unprofitable bids or losing profitable ones
- Competitors adopting AI takeoff tools are submitting 3–5x more bids per estimator, structurally outcompeting manual shops

**Their actual edge:**
Bobyard runs dozens of proprietary computer vision models built from scratch for construction drawings—not fine-tuned general models. First-run accuracy exceeds 95% with 90%+ automation of the takeoff task. They started with landscaping, the most visually complex trade (thousands of arbitrary symbols varying project to project), which means their CV pipeline is battle-tested on the hardest problem. Competitors like Togal.AI and Beam AI focus on general construction or aerial imagery; Bobyard owns the blueprint-to-bid workflow for landscaping specifically, with trade-specific templates, vendor quote databases, and assembly tracking built in.

## 3. Buyer Topology

| Persona | **Owner / CEO of $5M–$30M Commercial Landscape Firm** |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Role & Mandate** | Accountable for revenue growth, profit margins, and bid win rate. Often the final approver on estimates. At firms this size, the owner is frequently still the primary or sole estimator. |
| **Situational Qualifiers** | Company recently crossed $5M revenue and is pursuing its first wave of $1M+ commercial projects. Has 1–2 estimators max. Is turning down bids due to capacity. Bid season is approaching. May have recently lost a project due to slow turnaround or estimation error. |
| **What Keeps Them Up at Night** | "We're leaving money on the table because we can't bid fast enough. If my estimator quits, the business stops." |
| **How They Evaluate Solutions** | Demo-driven. Needs to see their actual drawings processed. Evaluates on accuracy first, speed second. Will benchmark against their current manual process on a real project. |
| **Common Objections** | "My estimator knows our pricing better than any software." "We tried [generic takeoff tool] and it didn't understand landscape drawings." "I don't trust AI with my bids—one bad estimate costs me more than the software saves." |

---

| Persona | **VP of Operations / COO at PE-Backed Landscape Platform** |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Role & Mandate** | Accountable for operational efficiency, integration of acquired companies, and margin improvement across the portfolio. Reports to PE sponsors on KPIs including bid-to-win ratio and estimating throughput. |
| **Situational Qualifiers** | PE firm acquired a landscape platform in the last 12–24 months. Actively rolling up 3–5 smaller landscape companies per year. Each acquisition brings different estimating processes, templates, and pricing. Needs to standardize estimating across acquired entities to realize synergies. Board is pushing for margin expansion. |
| **What Keeps Them Up at Night** | "Every company we acquire does estimating differently. We can't scale if every shop has its own tribal knowledge locked in one person's head." |
| **How They Evaluate Solutions** | ROI-driven. Needs to model impact across the portfolio. Will want to see case studies from similar-sized firms. Procurement process involves ops, finance, and PE sponsor input. Longer sales cycle (2–4 months). |
| **Common Objections** | "We're mid-integration on three acquisitions—adding new software right now is a distraction." "Our portfolio companies use different drawing formats; can this handle all of them?" |

## 4. Signal Stacks

### Pain Point 1: Estimating Capacity Bottleneck

| Current State | Desired Future |
|---------------|----------------|
| One or two estimators manually processing every bid. Working 50+ hour weeks during bid season. Turning away RFPs because they physically cannot respond in time. Owner is still doing takeoffs instead of selling or managing. | Estimators handle 3–5x current bid volume without additional headcount. Owner freed from takeoff work. Consistent, accurate bids with predictable margins. Ability to bid on any project within 24–48 hours. |

**Signal Stack (Evidence Required):**

| Signal Type | What to Look For | Why It Matters |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Situational** | Commercial landscape firm in $5M–$25M revenue range with fewer than 3 estimators on staff | Proves they're at the size where estimating capacity becomes the binding constraint on growth |
| **Execution** | Job posting for a landscape estimator — especially first-ever hire, or posting open 60+ days unfilled | Proves they're trying to solve the capacity problem through headcount (expensive, slow) |
| **Pain** | Bid volume or revenue plateaued despite growing pipeline; posted publicly about turning away work | Proves the capacity constraint is actively painful, not theoretical |
| **Active Search** | Visiting G2/Capterra pages for takeoff software; downloading estimating guides; attending efficiency webinars | Proves they're already looking — higher intent but more competitive |

**Conviction Threshold:** Situational + Execution + Pain all present → enters play. Active Search also present → immediate outbound.

---

### Pain Point 3: PE-Driven Standardization Post-Acquisition

| Current State | Desired Future |
|---------------|----------------|
| PE firm has acquired 2–5 landscape companies. Each uses different estimating methods — some on paper, some in Excel, some in legacy software. No consistency in pricing, markup assumptions, or takeoff methodology. Can't benchmark performance across portfolio companies. | Standardized estimating platform across all portfolio companies. Consistent pricing and margin assumptions. Reduced key-person risk. Faster integration of future acquisitions. |

**Signal Stack (Evidence Required):**

| Signal Type | What to Look For | Why It Matters |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Situational** | PE firm announces acquisition of a commercial landscape company, or PE-backed platform announces a tuck-in | Proves they're in the consolidation phase where standardization becomes urgent |
| **Execution** | PE-backed platform posting for VP Ops, Director of Preconstruction, or "integration" roles | Proves they're actively building the operational infrastructure where Bobyard fits |
| **Pain** | Portfolio company losing margin post-acquisition; leadership turnover at acquired companies | Proves standardization isn't happening organically |

**Conviction Threshold:** Situational (acquisition announcement) + Execution (operational hiring) is sufficient. Strategic sale with longer cycle but much larger deal size (multi-entity deployment).

## 5. Individual Signal Hypotheses (2 of 10 shown)

### Signal 1: Landscape Estimator Job Posting Open 30+ Days

**Observable Indicator:**
Job posting on Indeed, ZipRecruiter, or LinkedIn for "Landscape Estimator" or "Preconstruction Estimator" at a commercial landscape firm, open for 30+ days without being filled. Pay range $60K–$120K signals a senior hire.

**Causal Logic:**
Unfilled estimator posting → firm is capacity-constrained on bids → trying to solve with headcount but can't find talent (92% of contractors report hiring difficulty) → receptive to a tool that gives existing team 3–5x throughput instead of waiting months to fill an $80K+ role.

**Signal Validation:**

| Check | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| **Exists in the wild?** | Indeed, ZipRecruiter, LinkedIn, Glassdoor. Easily monitored with job board APIs. |
| **Recent example?** | As of early 2026: 275+ landscape estimator positions open in Texas alone, 117 in New Jersey. Multiple open 60+ days. |
| **Estimated annual volume** | ~2,000–4,000 landscape estimator postings annually across the U.S. |
| **GTM motion** | High volume → automated monitoring via job board APIs. Templatized outreach referencing their specific posting. |

**Timing:** Peak window is days 30–60 after posting. By day 90+, they've either filled it, given up, or restructured. Late-stage angle: if they hired, pivot to "make your new hire 3x more productive from Day 1."

**Signal Score:**

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Volume | 4 | 2,000–4,000 annual postings nationally |
| Detectability | 5 | Fully automatable via job board APIs |
| Specificity | 4 | Directly indicates the estimating capacity pain Bobyard solves |
| Timing Precision | 4 | Event-triggered with ~30-day window |
| Actionability | 5 | Ready for automated trigger + personalized template |
| **Composite** | **4.45** | |

---

### Signal 2: PE Acquisition of a Commercial Landscape Company

**Observable Indicator:**
Press release, SEC filing, or trade publication announcing a PE firm acquiring a commercial landscape contractor — or a PE-backed landscape platform announcing a new tuck-in acquisition.

**Causal Logic:**
PE acquisition → new owners push for operational standardization and margin improvement → estimating is one of the first processes to audit (directly impacts bid-to-win ratio and profitability) → within 6–12 months, the platform needs a scalable estimating solution across multiple acquired entities.

**Signal Validation:**

| Check | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| **Exists in the wild?** | PitchBook, Crunchbase, BusinessWire, Landscape Management, SEC filings. |
| **Recent example?** | Ares Management acquired majority stake in Landscape Workshop (May 2025). Russell Landscape Group completed 5th acquisition under The Sterling Group (2024). PE accounted for 76% of landscaping services deal volume in 2025. |
| **Estimated annual volume** | ~30–50 PE-backed landscape platform transactions per year. |
| **GTM motion** | Medium volume → manual tracking via PitchBook alerts + trade publications. Consultative outreach targeting VP Ops or COO at platform level. |

**Timing:** Peak window is months 3–9 post-acquisition. First 90 days are chaos. By month 3, operational improvement initiatives begin. Low decay — standardization need persists 12–24 months, especially with additional tuck-ins.

**Signal Score:**

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Volume | 2 | ~30–50 transactions annually |
| Detectability | 4 | Available via structured data source (PitchBook, press releases) |
| Specificity | 5 | Only explainable by the exact standardization problem Bobyard solves |
| Timing Precision | 3 | Seasonal pattern — 3–9 month post-acquisition window |
| Actionability | 4 | Ready for templatized outreach with deal-specific personalization |
| **Composite** | **3.70** | |

## 6. Competitive Intelligence Summary

**Where Bobyard wins:**
- Commercial landscape installation projects ($3M–$20M+) with thousands of trade-specific symbols. No competitor matches Bobyard's landscape-specific CV depth.
- Mid-market contractors ($5M–$30M) who need a purpose-built tool, not a generic construction platform.
- Speed + accuracy: 95%+ first-run accuracy with 90%+ automation.

**Where Bobyard loses:**
- Multi-trade general contractors needing one platform across electrical, mechanical, plumbing, and landscape. Beam AI's breadth wins today.
- Maintenance-focused landscapers doing mowing and snow removal. SiteRecon's aerial imagery approach is better suited.
- Price-sensitive small contractors (<$2M revenue) who can't justify SaaS spend.

**Gap in the market:**
No competitor is running signal-based outbound tied to job postings, PE acquisitions, or residential-to-commercial transitions. The market defaults to trade shows, SEO, and partner channels. None are targeting PE-backed rollup platforms as a dedicated segment — that's a blue ocean with 30+ active PE platforms in landscaping.

## 7. Research Confidence Assessment

**High confidence:**
- Product, positioning, core value prop (well-documented across press and investor materials)
- Competitive landscape and differentiation (multiple corroborating sources)
- Industry macro trends: estimator shortage, PE consolidation, resi-to-commercial transition (AGC, NALP, trade publications)

**Low confidence / gaps:**
- Actual pricing model and contract structure (not publicly available)
- Customer churn or dissatisfaction signals (no G2/Capterra reviews found — product may be too new)
- Win/loss data against specific competitors
- What signals Bobyard's own sales team is already monitoring

**Signals marked theoretical:**
- Signal 6 (Company Posts "We're Booked"): Strong causal logic but no specific named example found
- Signal 9 (Estimator Departure): Pattern is structurally certain but individual departures rarely publicly announced
